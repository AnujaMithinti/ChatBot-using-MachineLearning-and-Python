# ChatBot-using-MachineLearning-and-Python
It is a basic Chatbot created using Machine Learning and Python that is trained on basic intentions of user in that platform. 
Objective:
Develop a conversational chatbot using TensorFlow and Keras for natural language understanding and generation. The bot responds to user inputs based on predefined intents and responses stored in a JSON file.

Technologies and Libraries:

TensorFlow & Keras: For building and loading the neural network model.
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing tasks.
scikit-learn: For preprocessing and label encoding.
Flask: For web deployment (optional, not used in the Colab notebook).
Colorama: For colored terminal output.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
pickle: For saving and loading the tokenizer and label encoder objects.
IPython Widgets: For creating an interactive interface in Google Colab.
Files Needed:

intents.json: Contains the predefined intents and responses for the chatbot.
chat_model: Trained model file (saved in Keras format).
tokenizer.pickle: Pickled tokenizer object for text preprocessing.
label_encoder.pickle: Pickled label encoder object for encoding class labels.
